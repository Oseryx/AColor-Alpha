# Color-Picker
This app is based on the awesome work of [Toinane](https://github.com/Toinane)'s Color-picker, the main goal of it, is to give all possible options for color selection and management, it supports:
- Hex
- RGB
- HSV
- HSL

But still some fixes to do like the color property window that hasn't alpha property support.

This app has also a advanced storage system, where you can create folders and sub-folders and so on and in each folder you can store your colors.

Of course this is a beta still a lot of improvements to do for the ui/ux, available options and add new feautures and add customization to it
